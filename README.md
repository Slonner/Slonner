### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Slonner/Slonner** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding containers, ubuntu basic functionning, learn about cryptocurrencies and finally bots (for trading or social media) are fascinating me
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... I'm more like currently discovering things, learning is coming in the way
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a very simple trading bot but I am shy and I'm still processing the fuctionning of GitHub
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with few apps supposed to be easy as Docker, Python programming, bots creation, API platforms
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about financial analysis, budgetizations, see if you're project would do profits and I have money to invest in someone project too
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: here or slonner@tutanota.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Slonner
- âš¡ Fun fact: Due to the fear of inflation I just ordered my financial advisor to give me back everything it kept what was mine. Those dozens of thousands of EUR have to be invested and I wait for your idea to partner up.
